> Another one ? WHY ?

I've been looking for a simple file sharing solution; pretty and minimalist interface, fast and secure file sharing, and easy to deploy. I've tried many solutions, [Picsur](https://github.com/CaramelFur/Picsur/tree/master), [UploadThing](https://uploadthing.com/), but none of them met my requirements, even more, for free. So I decided to create my own solution, SnapFileThing.
