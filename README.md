## üöÄ What is SnapFileThing?

SnapFileThing is a lightweight, database-less, and performant file sharing platform designed for simplicity and speed. It lets you securely upload, manage, and share files from your own server, with a beautiful and responsive interface. Whether you need direct URLs for your files, thumbnails for your assets, or a complete file explorer, SnapFileThing has you covered‚Äîwithout any of the bloat or restrictions of other solutions.

## üèÜ Why SnapFileThing?

> Inspired by [Picsur](https://github.com/CaramelFur/Picsur/tree/master) and [UploadThing](https://uploadthing.com/), but built to fit my own needs.

While exploring existing solutions to host pictures for my [Portfolio](https://ericphlpp.com), I found that paid tiers, missing UI features, and unnecessary complexity got in the way of my workflow. I needed a tool to simply host files on my own server, serve them directly (with thumbnails!), and manage everything through a modern, minimalist interface. SnapFileThing is the answer‚Äîa tool that just works, with no restrictions.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Perks

- **Dual-Port Architecture**: The Rust server runs on two separate ports:
  - **Main Port**: Hosts the secure local API, file upload endpoints, Swagger documentation, and the modern file explorer interface.
  - **Static File Port**: Dedicated to serving files only, providing a clean, fast, and isolated endpoint for direct file access.
- **QOI Format Integration**: QOI files are supported natively, offering faster and smaller lossless images compared to PNG, ideal for efficient storage and transfer.
- **Security by Design**: The separation of API/UI and static file serving minimizes attack surface and allows for fine-grained access control.

## üê≥ Quick Start

### Run with Docker (Recommended)

```sh
# Move the .env.example file to .env and configure it
cp ./backend/.env.example /.env

docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /your/files:/data \
  ghcr.io/Eric-Philippe/snapfilething:latest
```

- Replace `/your/files` with the path where you want to store your files.
- The Docker image is under 40MB and contains everything you need.

You can also run the Docker image inside a Docker Compose setup or with custom ports and environment variables:

```yml
version: "3.8"

services:
  snapfilething:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:8080" # Web Interface + API
      - "8081:8081" # Static files
    volumes:
      - ./uploads:/app/uploads
    environment:
      - RUST_LOG=info
    env_file:
      - backend/.env
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test:
        [
          "CMD",
          "wget",
          "--no-verbose",
          "--tries=1",
          "--spider",
          "http://localhost:8080/api/health",
        ]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s

volumes:
  uploads:
    driver: local
```

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
